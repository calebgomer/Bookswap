        h4 Tired of paying too much at the bookstore, only to get pennies when you sell your books back?
        h4 Forget to buy books until the last minute so you can't order them online?
        p Try Book Swap, a better way to buy and sell your textbooks.
        p Book Swap helps you find other students on campus who need your used books! You get to negotiate prices, not the book store.

        h4 Book List
        p Go to your Book List to add which books you are buying and selling. You can also add books you own but aren't selling. When you're done with a book, you can always move it to your selling list.
        p If you're on a desktop or laptop you can take advantage of the automatic textbook import. Just add the bookmark, look up your textbooks, and press the button.

        h4 Buy Books
        p When you've added all the books you want to buy, you can see if anyone else on campus is selling what you need, and look up online prices to get an idea of how much the books are worth.&nbsp;
          strong  Make sure you've added the books you're selling, too!
          | &nbsp;Book Swap only works if both buyers and sellers add their books :)
